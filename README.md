##Purpose
    This repository will track my progress through Georgia Tech's Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java course through EdX. As I am auditing the course, I don't have access to the graded assignments, so I will be creating my own programs to test and demonstrate my knowledge in the topics for each module. I will be restricting myself to using only skills learned in the module that I have just completed, and I will attempt to make my assignments as comprehensive as possible.

###Course 1
##Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java I: Foundations and Syntax Basics
#Module 2 Project:
    Create a simple budget report printer that uses native types, conversions, and formatted printing.
